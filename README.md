# ATAPI - C/C++ TAPI Client Library

This library is an old MFC application wrapper around the TAPI 2.0 client library.

It was really designed to test the TSP++ product created and sold by [julmar.com](http://www.julmar.com).

The samples include source code and a built version of each executable since the code likely will have trouble compiling with anything later than Visual Studio 2008.
